                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>
                  We founded Safe Dollar Studio in July 2024 in Johannesburg,
                  South Africa, after a campus game jam where our collaboration
                  earned an honourable mention. That early recognition inspired
                  us to keep creating together and led to a mentorship with
                  TwoNameGames, who guided us in turning our shared passion into
                  an official indie game studio. By March 2025, our team had
                  grown to six dedicated members, and a few months later — in
                  July 2025 — we were honoured to win Best Game at another
                  campus game jam. Today, we're in what we call our "Safe Dollar
                  Season" — a creative challenge where we develop a new game
                  prototype every two weeks. Through this process, we continue
                  to explore new ideas, push our creativity, and deliver
                  playful, innovative experiences to the gaming community.

                <h2>HONOURABLE MENTION</h2>
                <p>
                  In July 2024, we took part in a 3-day campus game jam, where
                  our team received an Honourable Mention for our game Lab
                  Rumble. This event marked the beginning of our journey — it
                  was the first time we worked together as a group, and it
                  ultimately led to the creation of Safe Dollar Studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lab Rumble is a 2D, projectile-based brawler where players
                  must fight for survival on a dying Earth. By picking up and
                  launching items scattered around a chaotic lab, players battle
                  each other for the last chance to escape. The one who survives
                  wins the game.

                <h2>BEST GAME</h2>
                <p>
                  In July 2025, we participated in a 3-day campus game jam and
                  proudly received the Best Game Award for our project Mage
                  Brothers. This achievement came just a year after our first
                  award, marking another milestone in our studio's growth and
                  creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mage Brothers is a fast-paced 2-player wizard shooter, where
                  players duel using a mix of unique attack and support spells.
                  But beware — every spell has its own twist! Each cast comes
                  with unexpected side effects that can impact both your
                  opponent and yourself, making every match unpredictable and
                  exciting.
